# Claudia Green

I'm an outgoing, ambitious and analytic junior developer hailing from Yorkshire and now living in London. After graduating from Loughborough University with First Class Honours, and going on to work in digital media marketing, I began searching for a way to combine love of logic and my creative streak.

From studying at Makers Academy, I have found what I was looking for in coding, and I'm seeking a junior dev role with extensive learning opportunities that will allow me to further build on my understanding of object-oriented design and clean, modular, test-driven code.


## Skills

#### ...with people

My friends and colleagues would describe me as good humoured, astute, reliable and community spirited. I have a genuine love for building up those around me, and reminding them of their strengths when they're too focused on the weaknesses.

I am a perceptive person, with a proven track record of working well in a team dynamic in both an educational and professional capacity. However, recently I spent a week working on a project as part of a team that was an utter disaster. I saw that team dynamics had fallen apart and morale was incredibly low, and I tried to resolve it in the most effective way I could. I wanted us to have something productive to take away from the week beyond the product, so called a retro and asked the group to score ourselves out of 5 on communication, respect, simplicity, courage and feedback. Ultimately it was a fantastic opportunity for reflection and the group parted on good terms, and I'd consider this one of my greatest professional achievements to date.


#### ...with speaking

Confident and effective when speaking in front of people, I enjoy engaging an audience with humour and anecdotes. I am an experienced public speaker, and have stood up comfortably in front of audiences of up to a thousand. I'm a direct individual, who enjoys sharing my ideas and opinions and I strive to make solid contributions to any team I'm working on.

In a previous role I had the opportunity to conduct interviews with individuals such as members of the GB Rowing Team, The Youth Sports Trust, & GB Olympic & Paralympic athletes whilst on video shoots; I loved speaking to and working with such a variety of people, and remained professional and unfazed despite the high pressure dynamic of interviewing.

#### ...with learning

I'm a voracious learner (with a voracious appetite :fork_and_knife:) and I love new information. I'm attentive and methodical in my approach to all learning, and I believe this compliments the fast cycle of hypothesis testing in coding. I am thorough, enjoy critical thinking, and reflecting on my own work to make sure that my skills are always improving.

I'm ambitious & aspire to be a female leader in the tech industry, and I want to be part of the movement to upskill the next generation of developers. I went from knowing nothing about coding to being able to build fully-functional, rigorously tested web apps in the space of 12 weeks. I can't wait to see what I can learn in 12 months.

## Talks

__Why the women's discount? (_April 2016_)__

_I co-hosted a talk to an audience of current students and staff on why Makers Academy offer its discount to women, and why this is relevant in the broader tech industry. This was a fantastic opportunity to combine my passions of gender politics and public speaking. I am sincerely proud that this talk has now been integrated as part of the Makers curriculum in an effort to better educate future developers on the gender gap in tech and what we can do to combat it._
